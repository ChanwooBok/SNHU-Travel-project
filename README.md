# Software Development Lifecycle

SNHU Travel Project - Sprint Review and Retrospective
-Overview
This repository contains the Sprint Review and Retrospective for the SNHU Travel project, developed as part of ChadaTech's pilot transition to the Scrum-Agile methodology. The project aimed to create an innovative travel application using the Scrum-Agile framework, allowing for iterative development and continuous feedback.

-Questions and Reflections
1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs is a critical aspect of software development. By understanding the client's requirements and translating them into user stories, I ensure that the development process remains focused on delivering features that directly address user needs. User stories serve as a bridge between the client's expectations and the development team's work. They break down complex requirements into manageable tasks, each with clear acceptance criteria. This approach not only keeps the development aligned with user needs but also allows for more accurate planning and prioritization within sprints. For example, in the SNHU Travel project, user stories such as "As a user, I want to book a flight easily" guided the development of specific features, ensuring that the final product met the client's expectations.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach to developing programs is grounded in flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement, all of which are core principles of Agile. I start by gathering user stories and breaking them down into smaller tasks that can be completed within sprints. This allows for regular delivery of functional features and continuous feedback from stakeholders. I hope to incorporate Agile processes such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives in my future work. These processes help maintain transparency within the team, allow for quick identification and resolution of issues, and promote a culture of constant learning and adaptation. For instance, the daily stand-ups during the SNHU Travel project ensured that everyone was on the same page, while the retrospectives allowed us to identify areas for improvement and apply those lessons in subsequent sprints.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means actively contributing to the team's goals, communicating effectively, and being willing to adapt to changes. It involves collaborating with others, sharing knowledge, and supporting teammates when they encounter challenges. In an Agile environment, it also means being open to feedback and continuously striving to improve both individually and as a team. During the SNHU Travel project, I demonstrated these qualities by regularly communicating with team members, helping to remove obstacles, and participating actively in all Scrum ceremonies. This collaborative effort ensured that the project stayed on track and met the client’s requirements.

-Conclusion
The SNHU Travel project provided valuable insights into the Scrum-Agile methodology and its benefits in software development. By focusing on user stories, Agile processes, and effective teamwork, the project was able to deliver a high-quality product that met the client’s needs. These experiences will inform and guide my future development work as I continue to apply Agile principles.
